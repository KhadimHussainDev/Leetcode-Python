# Problem Description

A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.

For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.

Given a string `word` that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters ('a' through 'j'), you need to return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in `word`. If the same substring appears multiple times in `word`, then count each occurrence separately.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

## Example

Given `word = "ccjjc"`, the wonderful non-empty substrings are ["c", "cc", "cjc", "jc", "jj", "jjc", "ccj", "cjjc"], and the output should be 8.

# Approach

We can solve this problem using a bitmask technique along with a dictionary to store the counts of different masks encountered. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a dictionary `count` to store the counts of different masks encountered. Set `count[0] = 1` to handle the case when no characters are present.
2. Initialize variables `res` and `mask` to store the result and the current bitmask, respectively. Set both to 0 initially.
3. Iterate through each character `c` in the input string `word`.
   - Calculate the index of the character in the range 0 to 9 using `(ord(c) - ord('a'))`.
   - Update the bitmask `mask` by toggling the bit corresponding to the index using bitwise XOR.
   - Update the result `res` by adding the count of the current bitmask `count[mask]`.
   - Iterate through all possible indices `i` in the range 0 to 9 and update the result `res` by adding the count of the bitmask obtained by toggling the bit at index `i`.
   - Increment the count of the current bitmask `count[mask]`.
4. Finally, return the result `res`.

# Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def wonderfulSubstrings(self, word: str) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)
        count[0] = 1
        res, mask = 0, 0
        for c in word:
            index = (ord(c) - ord('a'))
            mask ^= 1 << index
            res += count[mask]
            for i in range(10):
                preMask = mask ^ (1 << i)
                res += count[preMask]
            count[mask] += 1
        return res
```

# Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `word`. We iterate through each character of the string once.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `word`. We use a dictionary `count` to store the counts of different masks encountered.
