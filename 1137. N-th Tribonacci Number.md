## Problem Description

The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows:

- T0 = 0
- T1 = 1
- T2 = 1
- Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0

Given an integer `n`, the task is to find the value of the Tribonacci number Tn.

## Approach Explanation

- **Algorithm Overview**:
  - Use iterative approach to compute the Tribonacci number for a given `n`.
  - Initialize the first three Tribonacci numbers (`first`, `second`, `third`) based on the given initial values (`T0 = 0`, `T1 = 1`, `T2 = 1`).
  - Check special cases (`n == 0`, `n == 1`, `n == 2`) and return the corresponding Tribonacci number directly.
  - For `n >= 3`, iteratively calculate the Tribonacci number using a loop:
    - Update `ans` as the sum of the last three computed Tribonacci numbers (`first`, `second`, `third`).
    - Update `first`, `second`, `third` for the next iteration.
  - Return the computed Tribonacci number (`ans`) for the given `n`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the input integer. The algorithm iteratively computes the Tribonacci number up to `n` using a loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the algorithm uses constant space for storing the current Tribonacci numbers (`first`, `second`, `third`) and a few additional variables (`ans`, `i`).

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        first, second, third = 0, 1, 1

        # Base cases
        if n == 0:
            return first
        elif n == 1 or n == 2:
            return second

        # Iteratively compute Tribonacci number
        ans = 0
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            ans = first + second + third
            first, second, third = second, third, ans

        return ans
```
