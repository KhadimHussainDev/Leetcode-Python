## Solution 1: Brute Force (Naive)

## Problem Description

The problem requires counting the number of '1' bits (popcount) in the binary representation of each number from `0` to `n` and returning the counts as a list.

## Approach Explanation

- **Count Function**:
  - This helper function (`count`) calculates the number of '1' bits in a number using bit manipulation (Brian Kernighan's algorithm). It iteratively counts the number of set bits (`1` bits) in the binary representation of a number by repeatedly turning off the lowest set bit.

- **Main `countBits` Function**:
  - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the counts of '1' bits for each number from `0` to `n`.
  - Iterate over each number `i` from `0` to `n`:
    - Append the result of `count(i)` (number of '1' bits in `i`) to `res`.
  - Return `res` containing the counts of '1' bits for numbers `0` to `n`.

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        def count(n):
            count = 0 
            while n:
                count += 1
                n = n & (n - 1)
            return count
        res = []
        for i in range(n + 1):
            res.append(count(i))
        return res
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * sizeof(integer)), where `n` is the input number and `sizeof(integer)` is the number of bits in an integer (typically 32 or 64). The algorithm iterates through each number and counts its bits.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the input number. The space complexity is dominated by the `res` list storing the results.

## Solution 2: Dynamic Programming (Optimized)

## Problem Description

The problem requires counting the number of '1' bits (popcount) in the binary representation of each number from `0` to `n` and returning the counts as a list.

## Approach Explanation

- **Main `countBits` Function**:
  - Initialize a list `res` of size `n + 1` to store the counts of '1' bits for each number from `0` to `n`.
  - Iterate over each number `i` from `0` to `n`:
    - If `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`), set `res[i]` to `res[i // 2]` (since even numbers have the same number of '1' bits as their half).
    - If `i` is odd, set `res[i]` to `res[i - 1] + 1` (since odd numbers have one more '1' bit than the previous even number).
  - Return `res` containing the counts of '1' bits for numbers `0` to `n`.

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                res[i] = res[i // 2]
            else:
                res[i] = res[i - 1] + 1
        return res
            
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the input number. The algorithm iterates through each number once to calculate the counts of '1' bits.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the input number. The space complexity is dominated by the `res` list storing the results.
