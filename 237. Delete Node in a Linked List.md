# Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, implement a method `deleteNode()` to delete the node in the list with the given reference to the node to be deleted. You do not have access to the head of the list, only the node to be deleted.

# Approach

To delete a node from a singly linked list without access to the head of the list, we can copy the value of the next node to the node to be deleted and then remove the next node from the list. This effectively replaces the current node with the next node while maintaining the structure of the linked list.

1. **Value Replacement**: Copy the value of the next node to the current node to be deleted. This effectively "deletes" the current node by replacing its value with the value of the next node.
2. **Pointer Adjustment**: Update the `next` pointer of the current node to skip the next node and point directly to the node after the next node. This removes the next node from the linked list.

# Code

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:

  - The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it only involves constant-time operations. We are updating the value and pointers of the current node and its next node.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the linked list.
  - The space usage doesn't grow with the size of the input linked list.
