# Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zeros, you need to find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array.

Return the positive integer `k`. If there is no such integer, return -1.

## Example

Given `nums = [1, 2, 3, -3, -2, -1]`, the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array is 3.

# Approach 1

We can solve this problem using a two-pointer approach after sorting the array. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Sort the array `nums`.
2. Initialize two pointers `start` and `end` at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
3. Initialize a variable `large` to store the largest positive integer `k`.
4. Iterate through the array using the two pointers until `start` is less than `end`:
   - Get the values at the current pointers, `negative` and `positive`.
   - If `negative` is greater than 0, break the loop.
   - If the absolute value of `negative` is equal to `positive`, update `large` to `positive` and break the loop.
   - If the absolute value of `negative` is less than `positive`, decrement `end`.
   - Otherwise, increment `start`.
5. Return the value stored in `large`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        large = -1
        while start < end:
            negative, positive = nums[start], nums[end]
            if negative > 0:
                break
            if abs(negative) == positive:
                large = positive
                break
            if abs(negative) < positive:
                end -= 1
            else:
                start += 1
        return large
```

# Approach 2

Another approach is to use a set to store the values of `nums`. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Create a set `dic` containing the values of `nums`.
2. Initialize a variable `large` to store the largest positive integer `k`.
3. Iterate through the elements of `nums`:
   - If the negation of the current element exists in the set `dic`, update `large` to the maximum of `large` and the absolute value of the current element.
4. Return the value stored in `large`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxK(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dic = set(nums)
        large = -1
        for num in nums:
            if num * -1 in dic:
                large = max(large, abs(num))
        return large
```

# Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N log N) for Approach 1 due to sorting, and O(N) for Approach 2 using sets.
- Space Complexity: O(N) for Approach 1 due to sorting, and O(N) for Approach 2 using a set.
