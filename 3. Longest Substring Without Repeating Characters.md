## Problem: LeetCode 3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Solution 1 - Sliding Window Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if len(s) < 2:
            return len(s)
        max_length = 0
        first, second = 0, 1
        sub = set()
        sub.add(s[0])
        while first < len(s) and second < len(s):
            ch = s[second]
            if ch in sub:
                while ch in sub:
                    sub.remove(s[first])
                    first += 1
                continue
            second += 1
            sub.add(ch)
            max_length = max(max_length, len(sub))
        return max_length
```

**Explanation**:

- Initialize two pointers (`first` and `second`) to represent the sliding window boundaries.
- Use a set (`sub`) to keep track of characters within the current window (`[first, second]`).
- Iterate through the string `s` using the pointers:
  - If `s[second]` is already in the set (`sub`), shift the window by removing characters from `sub` until the duplicate character is removed.
  - Update `max_length` with the maximum length of unique characters encountered so far.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

### Solution 2 - Optimized Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_set = set()
        l = 0
        res = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in char_set:
                char_set.remove(s[l])
                l += 1
            char_set.add(s[r])
            res = max(res, len(char_set))
        return res
```

**Explanation**:

- Use a sliding window approach with two pointers (`l` and `r`).
- Traverse the string `s` with the `r` pointer:
  - If `s[r]` is already in the `char_set`, move the `l` pointer rightward until `s[r]` is no longer in the set.
  - Update the maximum length (`res`) of unique characters encountered.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

Both solutions use the sliding window technique to efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters. Solution 2 optimizes the process by directly adjusting the sliding window without explicitly removing elements from a set.
