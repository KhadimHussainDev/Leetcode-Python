## Problem Description

The problem requires identifying and returning the coordinates of all rectangular groups of farmland (`1`s) in a given binary matrix `land`. A group of farmland is defined as a connected region of `1`s where no two groups are adjacent (not four-directionally adjacent).

## Approach Explanation

- **Algorithm Overview**:
  - Initialize `rows` and `cols` to get the dimensions of the input matrix `land`.
  - Initialize an empty list `res` to store the results.
  - Iterate through each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix `land` using nested loops:
    - If the current cell represents farmland (`land[i][j] == 1`):
      - Check if the cell is the start of a new group by ensuring it is not horizontally or vertically adjacent to another `1`.
      - If it's a start of a new group:
        - Record the top-left corner `(i, j)` as `idx = [i, j]`.
        - Use two while loops to find the bottom-right corner of the group:
          - Extend `row` downward while it contains `1`s (`land[row][j] == 1`).
          - Extend `col` rightward while it contains `1`s (`land[i][col] == 1`).
        - Append the coordinates `[r1, c1, r2, c2]` of the group to `res`, where `r1`, `c1` are the top-left coordinates and `r2`, `c2` are the bottom-right coordinates.
  - Return the list `res` containing all identified groups of farmland.

```python
class Solution:
    def findFarmland(self, land: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows , cols = len(land) , len(land[0])
        res = []
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if land[i][j] == 1:
                    if (i > 0 and land[i - 1][j] == 1) or (j > 0 and land[i][j - 1] == 1):
                        continue
                    idx = [i , j]
                    row , col = i , j
                    while row < rows and land[row][j] == 1:
                        row += 1
                    while col < cols and land[i][col] == 1:
                        col += 1
                    idx.append(row - 1)
                    idx.append(col - 1)
                    res.append(idx)
        return res
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(rows * cols), where `rows` and `cols` are the dimensions of the `land` matrix. The algorithm visits each cell of the matrix once to identify and record the groups of farmland.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (ignoring the output space), if we consider the space used by the `res` list to store the results. The space complexity is dominated by the size of the output, which depends on the number and size of the farmland groups identified.
