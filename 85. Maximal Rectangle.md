## Problem Description

The problem requires finding the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed using only '1's in a binary matrix (`matrix`).

## Approach Explanation
Before solving this problem, it is recommended to solve this. [Leetcode 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/) 
Read Previous Technique here.[Explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/solutions/5015353/python-solution-using-monotonic-stack-with-explanation/)
1. **Matrix Transformation**:
   - Iterate through each row (starting from the second row) of the matrix.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix:
     - If the cell contains a '1' (`int(matrix[i][j]) != 0`), update its value to the sum of its own value and the value of the corresponding cell directly above it (`matrix[i - 1][j]`).

2. **Calculate Maximum Rectangle Area (As in Leetcode Problem 84)**:
   - For each row (now transformed into histogram heights), use a stack-based approach to calculate the maximum rectangle area that can be formed.
     - Initialize an empty stack to store indices and heights.
     - Iterate over each index `i` and height `h` in the current row:
       - While the stack is not empty and the height at the top of the stack (`stack[-1][1]`) is greater than the current height `h`:
         - Pop the top of the stack (`idx, he = stack.pop()`).
         - Calculate the area with the popped height `he` and the current index difference `(i - idx)`.
         - Update the `max_area` with the maximum of the current `max_area` and the calculated area.
       - Push the current index `i` and height `h` onto the stack.
     - After processing all heights in the row, handle any remaining heights in the stack to calculate potential areas.

3. **Return Maximum Rectangle Area**:
   - The `max_area` variable will contain the maximum rectangle area that can be formed using only '1's in the input matrix.

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # Get the number of rows and columns in the matrix
        ROWS, COLS = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        
        # Initialize the maximum area variable
        max_area = 0
        
        # Update the heights of the matrix for each row based on the previous row
        for i in range(1, ROWS):
            for j in range(COLS):
                # Convert the current element to integer (height)
                current_height = int(matrix[i][j])
                
                # Add the height of the previous row to the current element if it's not zero
                if current_height != 0:
                    matrix[i][j] = current_height + int(matrix[i - 1][j])
        
        # Iterate through each row (now representing heights) to calculate the maximal rectangle
        for height in matrix:
            stack = []
            for i, h in enumerate(height):
                idx = i
                if not stack:
                    # If the stack is empty, push the current index and height onto the stack
                    stack.append([i, int(h)])
                    continue
                
                # Process the stack to calculate the maximal area
                while stack and stack[-1][1] > int(h):
                    # Pop from the stack and calculate the area
                    popped_idx, popped_height = stack.pop()
                    max_area = max(max_area, (i - popped_idx) * popped_height)
                
                # Push the current index and height onto the stack
                stack.append([idx, int(h)])
            
            # Calculate the remaining areas from the stack after iterating through the row
            while stack:
                popped_idx, popped_height = stack.pop()
                max_area = max(max_area, (COLS - popped_idx) * popped_height)
        
        # Return the maximum area found
        return max_area

```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(ROWS * COLS), where `ROWS` is the number of rows and `COLS` is the number of columns in the input matrix. The algorithm involves processing each cell in the matrix and performing stack operations on each row.
- **Space Complexity**: O(COLS), where `COLS` is the number of columns in the input matrix. This is due to the space used by the stack to store indices and heights for each row.
