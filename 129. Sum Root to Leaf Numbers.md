## Problem Description

The problem requires calculating the sum of all root-to-leaf paths represented as numbers in a binary tree.

## Approach Explanation

This solution uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and collect all root-to-leaf paths as strings:

- **Helper Function (`helper`)**:
  - This recursive function takes a `root` node and a `path` string as arguments.
  - If the current `root` node is `None`, the function returns.
  - Append the string representation of `root.val` to the `path`.
  - If the `root` node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no left or right children), append the `path` to the `paths` list.
  - Recursively call `helper` on the left child (`root.left`) and then on the right child (`root.right`), passing the updated `path`.

- **SumNumbers Function**:
  - Initialize an empty list `paths` to store all root-to-leaf paths.
  - Call the `helper` function with the input `root` node and an empty string `""` as the initial path.
  - Initialize `total` to 0.
  - Iterate through each path in `paths`:
    - Convert the path string to an integer and add it to `total`.
  - Return `total`, which represents the sum of all root-to-leaf paths as numbers.


```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        paths = []

        def helper(root , path):
            if not root:
                return
            path += str(root.val)
            if not(root.left or root.right):
                paths.append(path)
                return
            helper(root.left, path)
            helper(root.right, path)
        helper(root , "")
        total = 0
        for p in paths:
            total += int(p)
        return total
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The algorithm traverses each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h + n), where `h` is the height of the binary tree (height of the call stack during recursion) and `n` is the number of nodes. The space complexity is dominated by the recursive call stack and the `paths` list storing all root-to-leaf paths.
