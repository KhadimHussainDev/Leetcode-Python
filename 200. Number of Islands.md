## Problem Description

The problem requires counting the number of distinct islands in a 2D grid, where each cell can either be land (`'1'`) or water (`'0'`). An island is formed by connecting adjacent (left, right, up, or down) land cells (represented by `'1'`) horizontally or vertically.

## Approach Explanation

- **Algorithm Overview**:
  - Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of distinct islands.
  - Define a helper function `dfs(i, j)` to perform Depth-First Search (DFS) to mark all connected land cells (adjacent `'1'` cells) as visited.
    - If the current cell `(i, j)` is out of bounds or is not land (`grid[i][j] != '1'`), return immediately.
    - Mark the current cell as visited by setting `grid[i][j] = '#'`.
    - Recursively call `dfs` for the adjacent cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i, j+1)`.
  - Get the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`) in the given `grid`.
  - Iterate through each cell of the `grid` using nested loops:
    - If the current cell represents land (`grid[i][j] == '1'`), increment the `count` and start a DFS from that cell to mark all connected land cells.
  - Return the final value of `count`, which represents the number of distinct islands.

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        def dfs(i , j):
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != "1":
                return 
            grid[i][j] = "#"
            dfs(i - 1 , j)
            dfs(i + 1 , j)
            dfs(i , j - 1)
            dfs(i , j + 1)
        
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    dfs(i , j)
                    count += 1
        return count
                    
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(rows * cols), where `rows` and `cols` are the dimensions of the `grid`. The DFS visits each cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (ignoring recursion stack space), if we consider the grid modification as an in-place operation. The space complexity is dominated by the implicit recursion stack due to DFS traversal.
