# Problem Description

You're given two strings, `s1` and `s2`. You need to determine whether `s1` can be formed as a substring of `s2` by permuting the characters of `s1`.

# Approach 1

In this approach, we use two arrays to count the occurrences of characters in both strings. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an array `arr` of size 26 to count the occurrences of characters in `s1`.
2. Iterate through each character in `s1` and increment the corresponding count in `arr`.
3. Initialize two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the window of `s2` that we're considering.
4. Define a helper function `isEqual()` to check whether the counts of characters in the current window of `s2` match the counts in `arr`.
5. Iterate through each character in `s2` using the `r` pointer:
   - Update the count of the current character in the window of `s2`.
   - Check if the counts in the current window of `s2` match the counts in `arr` using the `isEqual()` function.
   - If the counts match, return `True`.
   - If the counts don't match, move the `l` pointer until the counts match again.
6. If no matching substring is found, return `False`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        arr = [0] * 26
        for ch in s1:
            arr[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1
        l = 0
        sub_arr = [0] * 26
        def isEqual():
            for i in range(26):
                if arr[i] != sub_arr[i]:
                    return False
            return True
        for r in range(len(s2)):
            i = ord(s2[r]) - ord('a')
            sub_arr[i] += 1
            if isEqual():
                return True
            while sub_arr[i] > arr[i]:
                sub_arr[ord(s2[l]) - ord('a')] -= 1
                l += 1
        return False
```

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is O(N + M), where N is the length of `s1` and M is the length of `s2`.
  - The loop iterating through `s2` takes O(M) time, and within each iteration, the isEqual() function takes O(26) time, which is effectively constant.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array of size 26 (`arr`) to store the counts of characters.

# Approach 2

In this approach, we use two arrays to count the occurrences of characters in both strings, but we optimize the counting process. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. If the length of `s1` is greater than the length of `s2`, return `False`.
2. Initialize arrays `s1Count` and `s2Count` of size 26 to count the occurrences of characters in both strings.
3. Iterate through the first window of length `len(s1)` in `s2` and update the counts in `s2Count`.
4. Count the number of matches between `s1Count` and `s2Count`.
5. Slide the window through `s2`, updating the counts in `s2Count` and checking for matches.
6. If all counts in `s1Count` match the corresponding counts in `s2Count`, return `True`.
7. If no matching substring is found, return `False`.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkInclusion(self, s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
        if len(s1) > len(s2):
            return False
        s1Count, s2Count = [0] * 26, [0] * 26
        for i in range(len(s1)):
            s1Count[ord(s1[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
            s2Count[ord(s2[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
        matches = 0
        for i in range(26):
            if s1Count[i] == s2Count[i]:
                matches += 1
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s1), len(s2)):
            if matches == 26:
                return True
            idx = ord(s2[r]) - ord('a')
            s2Count[idx] += 1
            if s2Count[idx] == s1Count[idx]:
                matches += 1
            elif s2Count[idx] - 1 == s1Count[idx]:
                matches -= 1
            idx = ord(s2[l]) - ord('a')
            s2Count[idx] -= 1
            if s2Count[idx] == s1Count[idx]:
                matches += 1
            elif s2Count[idx] + 1 == s1Count[idx]:
                matches -= 1
            l += 1
        return matches == 26
```

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is O(N + M), where N is the length of `s1` and M is the length of `s2`.
  - The loop iterating through `s2` takes O(M) time, and within each iteration, updating the counts and checking for matches takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(26) = O(1) since we are using fixed-size arrays of size 26 (`s1Count` and `s2Count`) to store the counts of characters.
