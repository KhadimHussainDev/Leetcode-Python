## Problem Description

The problem requires calculating the perimeter of an island represented by a grid, where each cell can either be land (represented by `1`) or water (represented by `0`). The perimeter of the island is defined by the number of edges surrounding the land cells.

## Approach Explanation

- **Algorithm Overview**:
  - Initialize a variable `perimeter` to keep track of the total perimeter of the island.
  - Get the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`) in the given `grid`.
  - Iterate through each cell of the `grid` using nested loops:
    - For each cell at position `(i, j)`:
      - Initialize `taken` to keep track of the number of neighboring land cells.
      - Check the left neighbor (`grid[i][j - 1]`) if `j > 0` and add its value to `taken`.
      - Check the right neighbor (`grid[i][j + 1]`) if `j < cols - 1` and add its value to `taken`.
      - Check the top neighbor (`grid[i - 1][j]`) if `i > 0` and add its value to `taken`.
      - Check the bottom neighbor (`grid[i + 1][j]`) if `i < rows - 1` and add its value to `taken`.
      - If the current cell is land (`grid[i][j] == 1`), calculate the contribution to the perimeter using `4 - taken` (subtract the number of neighboring land cells from `4` to get the exposed edges).
      - Add the calculated contribution to the `perimeter`.
  - Return the final value of `perimeter`, which represents the total perimeter of the island.

```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        parimeter = 0

        rows , cols = len(grid)  , len(grid[0])

        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                # pre , nex , up , down = 0 , 0 , 0 , 0
                taken = 0
                if j > 0:
                    # pre = grid[i][j - 1]
                    taken += grid[i][j - 1]
                if j < cols - 1:
                    # nex = grid[i][j + 1]
                    taken += grid[i][j + 1]
                if i > 0:
                    # up = grid[i - 1][j]
                    taken += grid[i - 1][j]
                if i < rows - 1:
                    # down = grid[i + 1][j]
                    taken += grid[i + 1][j]
                if grid[i][j]:
                    # parimeter += 4 - pre - nex - up - down
                    parimeter += 4 - taken
        return parimeter
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(rows \* cols), where `rows` and `cols` are the dimensions of the `grid`. The algorithm iterates through each cell of the grid once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The space used by the algorithm is constant, independent of the input size.
