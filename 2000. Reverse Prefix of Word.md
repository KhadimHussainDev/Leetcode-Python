# Problem Description

Given a 0-indexed string `word` and a character `ch`, you need to reverse the segment of `word` that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of `ch` (inclusive). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.

For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".

Return the resulting string.

## Example

Given `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, the reversed segment starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of `d`, resulting in the string "dcbaefd".

# Approach

We can solve this problem using string manipulation. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Find the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `word` using the `find()` method. If `ch` does not exist in `word`, return the original `word`.
2. Slice the string `word` from index 0 to the index of the first occurrence of `ch`, inclusive. Reverse this segment using slicing and the `[::-1]` notation.
3. Concatenate the reversed segment with the rest of the string `word` starting from the index of the first occurrence of `ch` + 1.
4. Return the resulting string.

# Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reversePrefix(self, word: str, ch: str) -> str:
        idx = word.find(ch)
        if idx == -1:
            return word
        word = word[:idx + 1][::-1] + word[idx + 1:]
        return word
```

# Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `word`. The `find()` operation takes O(N) time, and reversing the prefix takes O(N) time as well.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `word`. We create a new string to store the reversed prefix.
